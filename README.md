# Fish the Phish

## A web-based game developed with HTML, Tailwind CSS and Javascript, showcasing the different phishing tactics in emails. 

Some of the features of the game include the following... 

* A timed attempt to differentiate randomized emails as **Legitimate**, **Spam** or as **Phishing** attempts, which can be toggled in the source code. 
* A score system with 10 points being awarded for classifying the email in the right category,
* And a 5 point deduction on the wrong classification.
* The player also gets a correction screen that shows the reason why the corresponding email is in a particular category
* The final score is displayed with a fun title for the user with additional resources about phishing.
